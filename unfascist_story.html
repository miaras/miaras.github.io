<p>The nation of Small Rivers was founded, officially, at 3:17 in the afternoon, on a Tuesday, by the baker’s nephew. This was not because he was ambitious, or even interested in politics, but because he was the only one present when the mayor choked on a cherry pit and could no longer chair the meeting. The minutes read, “Nation declared; first order of business: no more cherries at council.”</p>

<p>Nation, in the early days, was defined by the radius at which you could still smell a loaf cooling on the window sill. By this measure, the borders shifted daily. In summer, with a strong wind, the nation extended well into the next village; in winter, the scent barely cleared the bakery’s back door.</p>

<p>The enemy was damp. Not metaphorical damp, not a threat in human form, but the kind that swells the wood of a door until you have to kick it open. Citizens fought it with jars of salt and old newspapers pressed against the floorboards.</p>

<p>Purity was measured in the whiteness of the flour. The miller was summoned to council each spring to present the first sack, and the mayor would press it between his fingers, nod gravely, and declare it fit for the nation’s bread.</p>

<p>Traitors were those who cut a loaf before it cooled, letting the steam escape into the street where strangers might smell it. Such acts were rare, and punishable only by the withholding of gossip for a fortnight.</p>

<p>Destiny was the apricot orchard. It had been planted by the first council with the understanding that one day, when the trees bore fruit, the nation would be complete. The fact that the orchard was planted on soil better suited to cabbages was a matter of optimism.</p>

<p>The first crisis came when the flour delivery wagon lost a wheel at the border and the baker was forced to use rye. The bread came out darker, denser, and to some, treacherous. The mayor convened an inquiry, which concluded with the phrase, “Rye is permissible, provided it does not confuse the identity of the loaf.”</p>

<p>Rebirth followed the next week, when the apricot trees sprouted their first leaves in years. Citizens gathered to watch, nodding in approval, as though the trees had been persuaded by the rye incident to reconsider their loyalties.</p>
