            I'm Miara Sung, a Korean/American philosopher living in Amsterdam. I wash dishes for a living. I think about langauge, racial capitalism, and the divine.<br><br>
            Previously, I was a software engineer at Microsoft. I also did social currency research with a grant from Ethereum people. After that, I served as CTO of a Korean startup writing software to translate webnovels automatically. <br><br>
            At Microsoft, I was in the Windows Systems and Delivery (WSD) team as an intern, then in the Microsoft Search, Assistant and Intelligence (MSAI) team. In WSD, I worked on Windows internals, building a tool that computes disk drive metadata. I used dskmgr a lot and asked lots of questions about IOCTLs. I also wrote a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mrqzgzb8KmZpc3CGOFlchKrvGeYnHru4r1FlKX4Klek/edit?tab=t.0">letter</a> to the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer which went somewhat viral internally, in internal emails, the intern Slack channel, and Blind. In MSAI, I worked on autosuggest functions on Microsoft Windows products, and later on building the assistant you could talk to in natural language to do things. This was in 2018-2020; the technology now seems ancient, and is obsolete, with the rise of LLMs, and my former team is now managing Copilot.<br><br>
            After Microsoft, I worked on blockchain research for a bit and briefly ran a consulting firm where I took payments in my own currency. As my own currency wasn't accepted by my landlord, I paid rent through an Independent Ethvestigator Program grant. I mainly studied social currency, or the idea that people could simply print their own money and spawn their own economy. The idea led to the rise of SocialFi, but I wasn't very happy about the culture and I left blockchain for good.<br><br>
            Then I worked on <a href="https://toonyz.com">Toonyz</a>, a webnovel platform powered by AI translation and AI generated media. I was practically forced at gunpoint to work here and while I'm somewhat proud of the AI translation algorithm I built, I was never a fan of the AI generated media thing. Working on Toonyz made me intimately familiar with LLMs, their limitations and strenghts, and I was left with a lasting impression that, with some engineering tweaks, their translation is freakishly good, orders of magnitudes better than Google Translate or other NMT algoritihms. I left Toonyz to come to Amsterdam, where I currently work as a cook.<br><br>
            I've lived in Seoul, Bloomington, IN, Allendale, NJ, Carrollton, GA, Berkeley, Seattle and New York. I was born in Seoul, went to kindergarten in Bloomington, went to elementary back in Seoul, middle school in Allendale, and high school in Georgia, where I attended the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Academy_of_Georgia">Advanced Academy of Georgia</a>. Then I went to UC Berkeley, where I studied computer science and enough classes to construe a broadly philosophy-linguistics-anthropology-poetry major.<br><br>
            I've done poetry readings at Seattle Lit Crawl, Oakland EM Wolfman, New Orleans, and was invited to read at Hugo House. I'm a member of Kundiman PNW, though I'm not very active these days. My poetry has appeared on a number of magazines, and is forthcoming in <i>Abolishing Capitalist Totality</i>, a collection by Archive Books.<br><br>
            I also read and write on some philosophical issues, cultural theory, that kind of thing. At Berkeley, I founded Philosophy of Computation at Berkeley and taught a <a href="The Poetry of Computer Science, the Computer Science of Poetry.pdf">course</a> on philosophy of computation. My most recent publication is <a href="https://centreforexperimentalontology.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/acceleration-and-time.pdf"><i>Acceleration and Time</i></a>, where I build on Fred Moten to advance a theory of the universal machine as an aesthetic of blackness.<br><br>
            A long time ago, I made the indie game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6180_the_moon">6180 the moon</a> with some friends.

            암스테르담에 살고 있는 한국인/미국인 철학자 성민아입니다. 식당일로 밥 벌어먹고 삽니다. 언어, 인종자본주의, 그리고 신성함에 대해 생각합니다.<br><br>
            마이크로소프트에서 개발자로 일한 경력이 있습니다. 이더리움에서 후원받으며 social currency 연구를 했고,  한국 스타트업에서 CTO로써 웹소설을 자동으로 번역하는 프로그램을 개발했습니다. 서울, 블루밍턴, 캐롤턴, 버클리, 시애틀, 뉴욕에 살았습니다.<br><br>
            시애틀 Lit Crawl, 오클랜드 EM Wolfman, 뉴올리언스에서 시를 읽었고 휴고 하우스 낭송회에 초대받았습니다. Kundiman PNW의 회원으로 있습니다 (요즘은 별로 활동 안합니다). 여러 매거진에 시를 출판했고, Archive Books의 책 <i>Abolishing Capitalist Totality</i> (자본주의 전체성을 폐지하라)에 시가 실릴 예정입니다.<br><br>
            철학, 문화 이론, 이런것도 읽고 씁니다. 버클리에 있을때는 버클리 전산 철학 모임을 창립했고, 전산 철학에 대한 수업을 가르쳤습니다. 가장 최근에 출판한 글은 <a href="https://centreforexperimentalontology.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/acceleration-and-time.pdf"><i>Acceleration and Time</i></a> (가속과 시간)으로, 프레드 모튼의 이론을 토대로 범용 (튜링) 기계를 흑(인)성의 미학으로 이해하는 이론을 시도했습니다.<br><br>
            오래 전, 친구들과 인디게임 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6180_the_moon">6180 the moon</a>을 만들었습니다.
