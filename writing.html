                    This paper is about uncomputability as freedom. It defines uncomputability as good, from which
                    follows that computing what is uncomputable is bad.

                            The conclusion is wrong. I said that once there is uncomputable AI, the human race might as
                            well go extinct. I don't think this is true. First, I don't think there can be uncomputable
                            AI. Second, even if there were, I think the human race shouldn't go extinct for important
                            sentimental reasons.

                    Charles Mills. I consider the possibility that racists are nowhere, cannot experience, and do not
                    die.

                    This is a collection of notes I wrote when I was teaching CS198-97 Philosophy of Computation at UC
                    Berkeley in Fall 2017. The class is designed to build up intuition about what computation is, how
                    computation is ontological, and culminates in a proof
                    of why you ought not compute an arbitrary human. For just this last part, see <a
