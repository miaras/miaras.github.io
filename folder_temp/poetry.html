하지만 어차피 그게 무슨 소용인가? 신경을 끄고 천장을 가만히 바라보다 보면 모기 한마리 날라와서 윙, 윙, 귓가에 웅웅댄다. 천장이 웅웅대고 엄마 잔소리가 귓볼에서 웅웅대고 엄마 잔소리를 한번만이라도 더 진중하게, 진중하게 들어볼 수 있다면, 아니 매일 아침 엄마 잔소리를 들을 수 있다면 얼마나 좋을까. 뉴욕에 있는 것 같다. 나를 생각하고 있을까? Not a day goes by where I do not think of you. Not a day goes by where I do not think of you. 나는 그대를 언제 잊을 수 있을까요. 그대의 모난 마음씨를 언제 둥글다고 입장을 바꿔 생각할 수 있을까요. 언제 악을 물리칠 수 있을까요.

The right way to think about the world is that it is a three dimensional structure, a very intricate puzzle-like structure, like a square piece of ramen. There are little holes every where on this piece of ramen, approx. 3mm-gaps along every noodle, and we would want each and every one of these holes to be glowing with light. It seems like some people, though, are intent on plugging them with concrete so that we cannot even eat the ramen anymore.

But so on, what is the use (or the sound)? Turn off attention and still, still, look at the still ceiling and as a result one unit of mosquito flies by and wings, wings, by the ear, oong-oong. The ceiling oong-oongs and mother's nontrivial and leftover comments oong-oong by the cheek of the ear and if only I could only one more time listen to my mother's nontrivial and leftover comments with seriousness, seriousness, no if each day I could hear mother's nontrivial and leftover comments how much good that would do. By an estimation, is in New York. , too, thinking of me, is they? 하루도 너를 생각하지 않는 법이 없다. 하루도 너를 생각하지 않는 법이 없다. Not a day goes by wherein the law is such that I do not think of you. Formally, when will I be able to lose you. Formally, when will I be able to shift perspective and see your square mind-seed as a spherical mind-seed. Formally, when will I be able to defeat evil. Formally, why is this world rolling slowly slowly into the pit of evil all day until the bell rings.

Love as a delegate for violence, or, mosquito <br>
<br>
roses are violet <br>
violence is pink <br>
in my chest <br>
violence is she <br>
her name is a pin <br>
her voice resonates <br>
    like far mountains <br>
    chopped bare of shrubbery <br>
    sad as a let-me-down and deserving blame <br>
 <br>
i know little about the dissident pick-me-nots <br>
kneeling yonder heads bowed in shame <br>
 <br>
the seedled remains <br>
of you remain <br>
 <br>
everyone's bones <br>
nourish the snow <br>
<br>
at each interval <br>
the dying mosquito<br>
 <br>
kneel in the snow <br>
nestle in my remains <br>
or what hard pains <br>
you nailed in now  <br>
  <br>

Whispered to me
<br>
The sky's white whiskers melt <br>
to hot snow, one dazzled morning. <br>
 <br>
I pick soft pomegranate seeds <br>
to smear them in your whispers. <br>
 <br>
You brushed my lips. The shattered chair <br>
stared gravely with its wooden eyes, <br>
 <br>
the gravity weighing in its sigh <br>
gently splintering its thighs, <br>
 <br>
the cerulean sky leaking forth <br>
freezing cloth, frosting teeth, <br>
 <br>
and your skin so red and round, <br>
molten, sweet, so on, alive! <br>
 <br>
I shoot my batch of crimson shells, <br>
pin them at the cotton morn. <br>
 <br>
They smear into the whiskers. <br>
The sky melts, eventual cerulean.  <br>

The Best of All Possible Worlds<br>
 <br>
There's nothing here but heads <br>
and heads, rolling along like <br>
cylindrical fish, some hairy heads <br>
and some bald ones, but every one of them <br>
in fact cabbages.<br>

, You fell a swooned<br>
volcano on my chest. You surrounded<br>
black olive trees and begged them for<br>
forgiveness. I sat high and tall<br>
and gray and my smiles were gray.<br>
<br>
I love her from a deep portion<br>
of significant peach-coreness that sits<br>
square and strong. I look at her<br>
and my answers disspiate.<br>
<br>
I left a tumbleweed inside<br>
my blankets, waiting for surprise.<br>
I waited for surprise. I waited for surprise.<br>
<br>
It's probably going to rain<br>
this day and all other days.<br>
She's checking the weather. She always is.<br>
<br>
My sloppiness crinkled her hair.<br>
<br>
I'll get ready to brush my teeth.<br>
<br>
What do you want?<br>
Excitement? Enlightenment? No, just an ability<br>
to sit down an enjoy a meal.<br>
<br>
When the old man came skimpering by<br>
the stubbled general asked a mean question.<br>
<br>
I stuffed the portabella with<br>
spoonfuls I took from your life.<br>
<br>
The remaining crumbs are eager to die.<br>
When will I crush them like maggots, stars!<br>
<br>
Don't you love her, though?<br>
    Don't you love her, though?<br>
Don't you want to pick up a can<br>
    and bury your head in the sand<br>
and deflower the beans off the can?<br>
Do canned food last<br>
    longer than you can? There is absolutely<br>
    nothing to do. The square bell, and defeat.<br>
<br>
7.<br>
Margins of the bed<br>
<br>
A field of wind gave license for defeat.<br>
I can't explain. The rain bent. The field of grass<br>
Looked dry and painted with cement.<br>
I pressed your cheeks the other night<br>
And laughed. You puffed like a fish.<br>
Tonight, the wind throws wet paint.<br>
I grumble and the only picture<br>
On my wall of you flicker and I lick my finger<br>
Nails. I can't explain. You seemed to bristle with shame,<br>
Those eyes so sharpened they were dull<br>
And gray. I couldn't explain.<br>
We talked all night but I can't explain.<br>
The wind can't explain the windowpane.<br>

Dear my mother in Korea<br>
<br>
Beaming in slightly different directions is <br> 
The surrogate for my mother. My mother died<br>
In a plane wreck several years<br>
And mountains ago. The townsfolk<br>
Covered her ears with snow thistle,<br>
Stuffed her mouth with smoked salmon,<br>
And tied her corpse to the back of a turtle<br>
Wading across the Wailing River. I realize<br>
Barren rocks hold the key to salvation.<br>
The green slithering snake of life,<br>
The rice sapling, the wind, and then<br>
The electric fan, playing a game of poker<br>
<br>
A sound in the bushes: the man with a dagger.<br>
Give him a hug so he may drown himself<br>
If he wants to, so he may carve a symphony <br>
On sulking, unblossoming corpses, because<br>
<br>
The drowned, wailing seamen long for home, home<br>
Before division, that dreamy landscape where<br>
Rice flowers bloomed and wild rabbits gave<br>
Chase to the moon and damn saplings,<br>
Roasting under heat of Sun, gave<br>
Their all for one good gamble. I give myself<br>
A pat on the back. I squeeze <br>
My bottle of whiskey. Now only if<br>
The sea would obey my every command.<br>
<br>
I long for a nation undivided,<br>
Starving, happy, principled, filled<br>
With worms, where this imagery<br>
Of squirming worms is a warm<br>
imagery, signaling<br>
Full moon and a harvest of golden proportions,<br>
Where this imagery of gold is warm<br>
Not because gold buys alcohol but because<br>
Our mothers’ sweat, inevitable and charmingly<br>
Beneficient below the jarring heat, is gold<br>
And heat, jarring ones, can be jarred<br>
And stored away for breakfast. Come morning<br>
We’d feast on heat and jam. Come noon<br>
We’d sit on the paddies drinking our<br>
Own sweat. Come night we’d huddle<br>
Around, tell stories of a bear<br>
That became a woman, where the only distraction<br>s
Are stars or hunger. And then we’d blow<br>
Deep into the roots of the fire<br>
Roasting the saplings and roaring alive.<br>
<br>
Sleep with the barren rock as our pillow<br>
Pillaged, the lives a method of peeling,<br>
The wind a method of kneeling,<br>
The man with the dagger a method of healing<br>
<br>
