    <blockquote>
        There they are. The racists. They shit. They eat. They breathe. Where are they? Where are they going? How are they going? There they are. Are they there? (They are nowhere.) They turn. They turn. They turn again. They <i>are</i> as they <i>turn</i>. "Don't their stomachs churn?" "How may they eat?" They turn towards me. They move. They move straight. They are straight towards me. (They have eyes on their backs. Their front-eyes and back-eyes work in unison, constantly switching duties.) They move straight towards me, all the while turning/being right, right, right. They are right and I am wrong. They are right and I am wrong. Wronged, I leave. They are there. I dare lift another leaf of the curtain. Where are they? The question remains. Are they? The question becomes. "What a mistake to have ever said <i>the</i>" racists.

    <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08347">How to Solve Moral Conundrums with Computability Theory</a> (First published May 2018, lightly revised Dec 2020)
    <blockquote>
        Various moral conundrums plague population ethics: the Non-Identity Problem, the Procreation Asymmetry, the Repugnant Conclusion, and more. I argue that the aforementioned moral conundrums have a structure neatly accounted for, and solved by, some ideas in computability theory. I introduce a mathematical model based on computability theory and show how previous arguments pertaining to these conundrums fit into the model. This paper proceeds as follows. First, I do a very brief survey of the history of computability theory in moral philosophy. Second, I follow various papers, and show how their arguments fit into, or don't fit into, our model. Third, I discuss the implications of our model to the question why the human race should or should not continue to exist. Finally, I show that our model may be interpreted according to a Confucian-Taoist moral principle.

    <b>Note</b>: an earlier version of the paper uses the word "shekallows" for "shallow benefits", and explicitly notes I use that term "because it sounds somewhat like shekels". Since then, friends pointed out that this may come across as antisemitic; and in private conversation, at least one philosopher has obliquely referenced this part of my paper, saying something crude which revealed their own antisemitism. (You know who you are.) Let me be absolutely clear. Not only do I unequivocally denounce antisemitism, Judaism is the religion most dear to my heart, and I am currently undergoing giyur. I referenced "shekels" because Judaism was and is a profoundest part of my personal and philosophical life. In fact, the easiest and perhaps truest way to understand this paper is through Judaism: I want to invite you to think about the claim made in the paper with respect to the notion of time as uncomputability, and the notion of time in Judaism (especially as articulated by Heschel), as similar notions: that all computable benefits ("shekallows"), however grand, pale utterly in comparison to the uncomputable majesty of time.

    <blockquote>
        Using computer science to talk about moral philosophy is a sort of perversion. In a sense, all philosophy is a sort of perversion. But as a smartypants once said, the purpose of philosophy is the dissolution of philosophy. I know at least a dozen grandmothers and grandfathers, most of them selling fish at a street market, who know everything this book can say and more. The audience I have in mind are the cynics, the highly educated, the "rationalists", who have retreated to their enclave, who refuse to believe anything that cannot be proven, who endorse things like utilitarianism, behaviorism, and <i>The Bell Curve</i>. I believe I can change their minds because they are rational, and rationality is an admirable ontological property. Rationality, for all its faults, does one job very well: when proven wrong, it clips off, however much it hurts, that irrational cancerous outgrowth, the misapplication of ego. What this book has tried to do is to show that the Modern Scientific World View, and its moral philosophy, which purports to be based on rationality, is utterly irrational. I tried to show this using something every "rationalist" would agree as a method for achieving rational truth: theoretical computer science.

    <a href="paper3.pdf">Paper 3: Uncomputability and the Categorical Imperative</a> (Dec 2017)
    <blockquote>
When Kant said we must not treat humans as mere means, but ends in themselves, he was saying that humans are arbitrary programs, not specific programs. Therefore, we <i>cannot</i> use them as mere means, and <i>must</i> treat them as ends in themselves. And the sense just used in <i>cannot</i> and <i>must</i> is not that of mere moral indoctrination. It is the authority of mathematics. So Williams has been answered: we legislate to the moral sentiments <i>by right of mathematical fact</i>.

    <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08502">Culture, Computation, Morality</a> (May 2017)
<blockquote>
I point to a deep and unjustly ignored relation between culture and computation. I first establish interpretations of Piaget's and Vygotsky's theories of child development with the language of theoretical computer science. Using these interpretations, I argue that the two different possible routes to Piagetian disequilibrium -- a tendency to overaccommodate, and a tendency to overassimilate -- are equivalent to the two distinct cultural tendencies, collectivistism and individualism. I argue that this simple characterization of overaccommodation versus overassimilation provides a satisfying explanation as to why the two cultural tendencies differ in the way they empirically do. All such notions are grounded on a firm mathematical framework for those who prefer the computable, and grounded on my personal history for those who prefer the uncomputable.

<blockquote>
Great power must be accompanied by great responsibility, which remains largely absent in Silicon Valley. The Valley's fantastical vision of a techno-utopian future where robots do all the menial jobs, Universal Basic Income is firmly in place, and everyone can freely pursue their creative endeavors, is just that: a fantasy. Between that fantasy of tomorrow and the reality of today is a gap into which real families, with real mortgages to pay and real mouths to feed, are falling into.

<a href="word_vector_survey.pdf">Identifying Semantic Components From Cross-Language Variation, Structured Lexical Sources, and Corpora: a Review of Recent Literature</a> (Summer 2016)
<blockquote>
Recent efforts on distributional semantics may be divided into at least four clusters: using more complicated mathematics to represent words and compositions of words, leveraging high quality structured knowledge bases, combining multiple languages, and going beyond corpus training data to visual, auditory, and olfactory training data, to giving the machine multiple modalities, so to speak. ... In what follows, I have listed papers of interest with a brief summary of their methods and, if particularly promising, an extended discussion of their formalizations and limitations.

    In 2012-14, I made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6180_the_moon">6180 the moon</a> with <a href="https://turtle-cream.com">Turtle Cream</a>. Through 2007-19, I was manager of <a href="http://cafe.naver.com/crazygm">CrazyGM</a>, the largest Korean indie game developers' community. <br><br>
    On and off between 2014 and 2018, I studied for a bachelor's in computer science and a bachelor's in philosophy at UC Berkeley. I did not graduate. I have been on a leave of absence since after Spring 2018.<br><br>
    In 2017-18, I taught "CS198-79: The Poetry of Computer Science, the Computer Science of Poetry", a course at UC Berkeley, as co-founder of Philosophy of Computation at Berkeley. Here is the <a href="pocab_book.pdf">Textbook</a> I wrote for the course, a <a href="syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a> for Spring 2018, the official <a href="https://pocab.wordpress.com/decal/">Website</a>, <a href="https://piazza.com/berkeley/spring2018/cs19879/home">Discussion Forum</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/philosophy-of-computation-at-berkeley">Course Notes</a>. <br><br>
    I performed my poetry at Seattle LitCrawl <a href="https://www.thestranger.com/events/33408369/cosmic-disconnect-a-reading">2018</a> and <a href="https://www.thestranger.com/events/41723761/readings-on-no-rape-and-calculation">2019</a>, <a href="http://wolfmanhomerepair.com/event/2019/12/4/poetry-night-jongmin-baek-and-manue">EM Wolfman</a> in Oakland, and the Rubber Flower Poetry Hour in New Orleans. <br><br>
    From October 2018 to September 2020, I was a software engineer at Microsoft Corporation, where I was part of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/msai/">MSAI</a> team. I worked on natural language query systems and knowledge graphs. At a conservative accounting, I brought in and conserved roughly $100MM for the corporation, and returned 99.7% of that for the privilege to do so.<br><br> 
    Currently I offer philosophical-technical consulting, mainly working in the Ethereum space. Former clients include <a href="https://sushiswapclassic.org">SushiSwap</a> and <a href="https://tryroll.com">Roll</a>. Contact me at my email if you are interested in my exotic services.<br><br>
