    I'm a Korean/American writer, philosopher, and technologist. I used to be a poet, active in the Seattle poetry scene from 2018 to 2020 through Kundiman, Hugo House, and LitCrawl. I don’t write poems anymore, but <a href="After Easter.pdf"><em>After Easter</em></a> is still my favorite collection.
  </p>

  <p>
    These days I write fiction—currently working on <em>God and Cola</em>, a cyberpunk, black comedy, satirical webnovel.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of all the titles I’ve gone by, “philosopher” still feels the most accurate. I think about racial capitalism, language, time, computation, and the divine. My core question: <strong>If the world were computation, what meaning could we still squeeze out of it?</strong> I don’t necessarily believe the premise—but I’m interested in what happens when we limit ourselves to something that bleak, that reductive. What meaning can we find, starting from this premise? A lot, I think.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08347v2"><em>How to Solve Moral Conundrums with Computability Theory</em></a> is my cleanest attempt to build a moral framework from that premise. <a href="https://centreforexperimentalontology.com/2021/03/22/acceleration-and-time-mina-baek/"><em>Acceleration and Time</em></a> links that framework to Black radical thought and Marxist theory.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then there’s <a href="The End of the World Has Already Happened.pdf"><em>The End of the World Has Already Happened</em></a>, a collection of notes from when I lost my mind around 2021. I was insane for a year or two. I’m stabilized now, but that period was, strangely, the most productive time of my life. The notes map out a world I built during that time—complete with “Goblin Theory,” my chaotic stab at abolishing racial capitalism.
  </p>

  <p>
    I studied computer science and philosophy at UC Berkeley, where I founded <em>Philosophy of Computation at Berkeley</em> and taught a course called <em>The Poetry of Computer Science</em>. The course notes became a book: <a href="The Poetry of Computer Science, the Computer Science of Poetry.pdf"><em>The Poetry of Computer Science, the Computer Science of Poetry</em></a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    From 2018 to 2020, I worked at Microsoft as a software engineer. When COVID hit, I changed my gender and quit. After that, I got paid for posting philosophical Twitter threads about “event-faithful currency” for the Ethereum community, where I was appointed as an “Independent Ethvestigator.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Now I’m CTO at a startup in Korea.
  </p>

  <p>
    Programming’s always been more than a job for me. I started at age 9. At 16, I released an indie game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6180_the_moon"><em>6180 the moon</em></a>. Code has always been personal—it's shaped how I think about the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lately, I’ve been thinking about translation:
    <ul>
      <li>If languages are libidinal flows tied to culture, what happens when you unlock the flows with translation algorithms that actually work?</li>
      <li>If text becomes image and video, can stories become universal again—not through reading, but through seeing?</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    To explore this, I’m building a webnovel platform that uses LLMs to translate fiction at 99% less cost—and then converts that fiction into visual and auditory media.

    Names I’ve published under: Jongmin Jerome Baek, Min Baek, Mina Baek, Miara Baek, Miara S Bekho, and Miara Shirokō.
