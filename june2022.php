  Disability
  What is a disability? Blindness is a disability. Fibromyalgia is a disability. Deafness is a disability. I think there are many kinds of disabilities.
  Disabilities may make life more difficult. If I was blind, I would bump into things and objects. But I do not have to think that my disability makes my experience of life less valuable. My experience of life is different because of my disability. But it is not less valuable.

  Itches
  There are three kinds of itches. The first kind is an itch that is not an itch at all. The second kind is another's itch. The third kind is your own itch. There are also itches that, when scratched, explode the universe. Don't worry about those.
  That "itch" sounds like "이치 "is written in the fabric of the universe. To scratch an itch is to understand an 이치. But if the 이치 cannot be understood by the scratching, there is a problem. Which is why we must be careful with our itches.
