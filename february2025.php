        I was looking through some of my old writing on this website and three stood out: <a href="may2022.php#Fixed Point">Fixed Point</a>, <a href="may2022.php#Jesus Christ Superstar">Jesus Christ Superstar</a> and "Don't forget to groan" (p10) in <a href="After Easter.pdf">After Easter</a>. I'm proud that even in madness I was able to produce these works of writing. For three years I've feared falling into insanity again, but after reading these again, that fear has largely gone. Writing has always been a way to keep track of time for me. I understand what that period of time was better now.

        God bless the USA. The emperor has no clothes. Trump's cabinet meeting starting with a prayer, the bizarre Trump Gaza video, Elon Musk saying "I am become meme". The scapegoat, the "cure": trans people not getting passports, the executive order defining nonbinary people out of existence, movements to overturn Obergefell. I don't know what will become of the USA but I hope a thousand transgenders will bloom in its anarchic wreckage.

        This website is back. Philosophy makes me go insane and I don't consider myself a poet anymore, but I'm writing a webnovel and building a webnovel website.
        As I obliquely argued in <a href="https://centreforexperimentalontology.com/2021/03/22/acceleration-and-time-mina-baek/">Acceleration and Time</a>, I think we in (sort of; I think capitalism is really starting to end) capitalism must anticipate capitalism's commodification of its critique and turn its logic on its head. As in, we shouldn't try to make our critique above capitalism, as that's bound to fail; we should instead make commodities that can't help but critique capitalism. It's a balancing act between making a commodity and making a critique, but what we can't do is pretend our critique is above commodification. That's why I like webnovels as the medium of critique.
        After speaking in riddles and going insane, I don't like speaking in riddles. I like to drill the point home in plain, entertaining language. However, in this website, which I'm sure nobody will visit except my biggest fans, I'll give myself more freedom to speak philosophically and in riddles. Really, I'm trying to be a normal person now. Insanity almost consumed me and being normal comforts me. I have to try. I don't want to slip back.
        See you soon!
